      question: "What are some common misconceptions about the role of financial advisers?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to have a financial adviser or do it myself?",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a broker and a fiduciary?",
      answer: "A fiduciary is legally bound to act in your best interest at all times. A broker is only required to recommend products that are 'suitable,' even if they aren't the best option for you."
